Galileo 1.3 MegaPixel Digital Binocular Camera,8/10,1.0,1162425600,review of binocular camera,"This item came in apparently good condition. Taking still pictures worked however it was supposed to be able to take video pictures as well. This I was unable to do. When i inquired about this I received an E-Mail that this item was not supported by manufacturer. I have since returned this item to amazon for refund."
Galileo 1.3 MegaPixel Digital Binocular Camera,1/1,1.0,1252368000,Galileo 1.3 MegaPixel Digital Binocular Camera,"Well, I did not see in the description, anywhere, that the software was made for a PC and not a Mac which is what I have. So, that was out. Then, when I tried to use it just as binoculars, I discovered that one of the lens was in backwards. So, on one side I saw what was in front of me but, on the other side it was backwards. I was not happy but, didn't send it in for a refund because I had thrown the box away. That's my last experience with Galileo until their products improve."
